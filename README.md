# Chat System v2
## Description
This is a secondary version of the chat system application that I had developed previously. In this version I'll be adding a rich user experience with an emphasis on the design of the user experience. I will also be changing the server language from NodeJS to Python and leverage SqlAlchemy to handle ORMs.
